# Armenian Text Transliteration Script

## Introduction

The Armenian Text Transliteration Script is a Python program that allows you to transliterate Armenian text into English. This script works character by character, with additional rules to ensure accurate transliteration. Whether you need to transliterate individual names or entire sentences, this tool has you covered.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3
- Pip (Python package manager)

You can install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Pip is typically included with Python, but you can install it separately if needed.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the script to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. Run the following command to install the required packages:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

**Usage**

# Excel File Requirements
Ensure that your Excel file adheres to the following guidelines:

The first column must be named "Armenian" (case-sensitive). This column should contain the Armenian text you want to transliterate.

Create a second column named "English" to store the transliterated results.

# Transliteration Logic
The script operates character by character, with additional rules for improved handling. It can accurately transliterate both individual names and sentences, making it a versatile tool for various use cases.

# Running the Script
Place your Excel file with the Armenian text in the same directory as the script.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

Run the script with the following command:

python transliterate.py

or just simply double click on the .py file.


# Reviewing the Results
The script will read the "Armenian" column from your Excel file, transliterate the text, and store the results in the "English" column. Open your Excel file to review the transliterated text.

# Advanced Options
If you encounter specific issues with the transliteration, you can adjust the script to suit your needs. The README provides a basic guide, but you can further customize the script based on your project requirements.

# Notes
The Armenian Text Transliteration Script is now equipped with enhanced functionality, supporting transliteration of both individual names and sentences from Armenian to English. It can be adapted to various use cases and different naming conventions.
